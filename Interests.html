<h2> My Interests</h2>
<P>
At school I am involved in Elon Finest dance team. It is the first hip-hop and coed club here and I enjoy spending performing and spending time with my teamates. When I am not doing that, I sometimes working on sets for Elon tonights Sketch Comedy Show. I have worked on set for a couple things but have participated more on the acting side. 
I am interested in all things art, from dancing, singing, drawing, and film. I enjoy trying new foods and enjoying cooking as well. I am alwasy looking for new recipes to try when I am on break. 


<p> 
   I also enjoy spending time with animals. Growing up I did not really have any pets. I did receive two fish from the state fair one year and I named them Flash and Swim Shady.
    Flash and Swim Shady unfortunatley did not live for very long and I was back to having no pets. If I could have as many pets as I want
    I think I would have at least one dog and one cat. I used to not be a fan of cats because when I was younger I got bit by one, but ever 
    since my sister adopted her cat Harlow, I love them. Harlow, named after the rapper/singer Jack Harlow, is very cute but likes to keep 
    to himself often. Occasioaly he will come sit with me but when he's done being around people he will retreat under a bed or couch.
